# Cachoeira

Data-oriented massively-parallel game and interactive-installation framework written in C++. Focused on being well-suited for spreading out work efficiently between multiple cores and heterogeneous architectures (hopefully ðŸ¤ž) and easy to develop for and extend.

## build

Cachoeira is developed with Visual Studio 2017 (Community Edition, mainly), and for the moment it has no external dependencies. Building is comprised of opening the project and hitting `Shift+Ctrl+B` or `F7` or `Build -> Build Solution`.
