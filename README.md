# Cachoeira

Data-oriented massively-parallel game and interactive-installation framework written in Rust. Focused on being well-suited for spreading out work efficiently between multiple cores and heterogeneous architectures (hopefully ðŸ¤ž) and easy to develop for and extend.

## build

Cachoeira uses cargo as the build system, to manage the library dependencies and linking. To build the library, use
```shell
$ cargo build
```
and it will download and build the project dependencies, then build the framework itself.
